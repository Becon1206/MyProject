                    <p> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies in web development. They work together
                        to create websites ranging from simple to complex. Getting familiar with and practicing these
                        technologies is the first step for you to dive into the world of web development.</p>

                    <h2>Implementing Login Page, Creating Courses, and Test Cases</h2>
                    <p>In web application development, one of the fundamental and essential features is the login page.
                        This page helps users authenticate their identity before accessing the services or courses
                        available in the system. Additionally, the ability to create courses for users or instructors is
                        a crucial feature in online learning platforms.</p>

                    <p>To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of these features, writing and executing test cases is
                        very important. Test cases help verify that the login page functions correctly, users can create
                        courses without issues, and the system operates as expected.</p>

                    <p>Implementing the login page, creating courses, and writing test cases are key steps in building
                        and ensuring the quality of a web application.</p>

                    <p>The "Add Courses" feature is a key part of any online learning platform. It allows instructors or
                        admins to create and manage courses. This feature typically includes functionalities such as
                        adding course titles, descriptions, materials (like videos, quizzes, and assignments), and
                        setting up prerequisites or levels. </p>

                    <h2>Building Courses and Creating Videos for Courses</h2>
                    <p>Building courses and creating videos are essential components of any online learning platform. As
                        an instructor or content creator, you can organize and present your materials in various
                        formats, with video being one of the most engaging ways to deliver content. Creating structured
                        courses involves defining course objectives, designing modules, and ensuring that each lesson
                        aligns with the learning goals.</p>

                    <p>Videos, on the other hand, serve as a powerful tool for explaining complex concepts,
                        demonstrating processes, or providing practical examples. By creating high-quality video
                        content, you can enhance the learner's experience and improve the effectiveness of the course.
